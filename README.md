# CombSign Detection
Code and Examples for our work on Comb-Sign Detection, submitted to MICCAI 2025.

Anonymised sample NIfTI files are contained here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J_WSm4VNIbKY6JqWFF5ZYT7i1-q89QNV?usp=drive_link

Instructions to view NIfTI files: NIfTI stands for Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative. It is a file format commonly used in neuroimaging and medical imaging to store 3D data. There are specific softwares to view such files in an interactive way. One such tool is NiiVue, an open-access software that can be easily installed, enabling users to efficiently explore and interact with NIfTI data.

Note that we have set the overlay to 0.3, meaning the maximum intensity is 0.3 * 255 = 76.

This approach was implemented to visualize the underlying gray matter features and provide a clearer understanding of how the comb-sign detection algorithm functions.

We promise to release the code, once the paper is accepted.
