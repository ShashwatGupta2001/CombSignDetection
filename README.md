# CombSign Detection
Code and Examples for our work on Comb-Sign Detection, submitted to MICCAI 2025.

Anonymised sample Niftii files are contained in 
1. Drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J_WSm4VNIbKY6JqWFF5ZYT7i1-q89QNV?usp=drive_link
2. examples folder (in process of updating files here)

Note we have set the overlay=0.3 which means the maximum intensity is 0.3 * 255 = 76 in max.
This was done to view the underlying gray features and give better idea of how the comb-sign detection is working

We promise to release the code, once the paper is accepted.
