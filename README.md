# CombSign Detection
Code and Examples for our work on Comb-Sign Detection, submitted to MICCAI 2025.

Anonymised sample Niftii files are contained in following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J_WSm4VNIbKY6JqWFF5ZYT7i1-q89QNV?usp=drive_link

Instructions to view the file:
A .nii.gz file is a compressed NIfTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) file format. There are several specialized programs that can open and visualize .nii.gz files. One such open access software is NiiVue. NiiVue is a web-based tool for viewing .nii.gz files in an interactive interface. You can upload the .nii.gz file directly to NiiVue to explore the data.

Note we have set the overlay=0.3 which means the maximum intensity is 0.3 * 255 = 76 in max.
This was done to view the underlying gray features and give better idea of how the comb-sign detection is working

We promise to release the code, once the paper is accepted.
